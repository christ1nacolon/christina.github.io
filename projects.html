    Having a mentor in college is crucial for surmounting unforseen challenges and accquiring guidance over the college and 
    professional landscape. Having such as amazing research mentor in the IU Department of Informatics truly inspired me to 
    become a mentor for other first generation students such as myself.  I get to help students plan for study abroad, find apartments
    for the first time, find tutoring/campus resources, find their own community on campus.

    The summer of 2018 I was granted the opportunity through the GROUPS scholars program to live on campus and 
    participate in undergraduate research for the first time. I learned to collaborate on high caliber subject matter, and was inspired to change my major from Biology to Informatics that very summer.
    Through my research I have been able to travel to present my findings as well as continue having an amazing mentor to help guide me in my journey to grad school.

    Serve IT is an on campus internship program which allows undergraduates to contribute to tech solutions for local non-profits. Through my experience in Serve IT I was able to consult clients for new websites and databases and work in teams on sprints to complete goals.
